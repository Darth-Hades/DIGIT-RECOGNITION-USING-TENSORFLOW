# DIGIT-RECOGNITION-USING-TENSORFLOW
Digit recognition using TensorFlow is a machine learning technique that identifies handwritten digits from images. It commonly uses the MNIST dataset and neural networks, especially CNNs. Images are preprocessed and trained to recognize patterns, enabling accurate prediction of digits from new input images.
